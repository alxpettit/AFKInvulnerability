TODO
- [x] Basic function
  - [x] Server-side idle player detection
  - [x] Block damage to idle player
  - [x] Make the player invisible
- [x] Make it so mobs already tracking the player at the time that they register as idle, stop doing so
  - [x] Maybe add something to mob tick that regularly tests if players are AFK and ignores them otherwise?
    - [x] Must find some way of accessing our mixin variable for that player instance outside of context... may require looking at player index :c
- [ ] `setTarget()` is a last minute injection. Would be better to inject into the code that evaluates target validity to begin with.
- [ ] Maybe add exemption for `/kill` commands, because as is, the player is immune to them when idle :P
- [ ] Configurable idle duration
