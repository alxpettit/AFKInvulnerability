TODO
- [x] Basic function
  - [x] Server-side idle player detection
  - [x] Block damage to idle player
  - [x] Prevent mobs, hostile and otherwise, from setting the player as a target
- [ ] Make it so mobs already tracking the player at the time that they register as idle, stop doing so
- [ ] Maybe add exemption for `/kill` commands, because as is, the player is immune to them when idle :P
- [ ] Configurable idle duration
- [ ] Currently mobs don't simple ignore players, they will actually ignore other targets around them too, because they keep trying to target the player. Must find better place to put the mixin.
